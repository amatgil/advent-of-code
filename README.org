* Advent of Code (solutions)

Combination of all my previous repos for aoc solutions (which were split by language and year) into one.

Rust {2021, 2022} are quite bad, and the old uiua ones are both bad and out of date (Uiua is not yet stable!)

Note that =elisp= does not have flake like the others, since =emacs= is (intended to be) installed globally.
